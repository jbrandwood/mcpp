This file summarizes new major features of each MCPP release.  (kmatsui)

MCPP V.2.6.2 (2006/11)

1. Fixed several bugs of the previous release.

2. Added subroutine-build to use MCPP as a subroutine from other main
    program.

3. Changed the terms of building methods in the documents.  The building
    methods now have two axis:
        1. stand-alone-build vs subroutine-build
        2. compiler-independent-build vs compiler-specific-build
    Refer to INSTALL #1.
    Note that this change of terminology does not affect the two
    building methods of stand-alone preprocessor so far: 'compiler-
    independent-build' and 'compiler-specific-build'. ('compiler-
    independent-build' was called 'stand-alone-build' in the previous
    releases).

4. Rewrote and converted the text files in 'doc' and 'doc-jp'
    directories into html files.


MCPP V.2.6.1 (2006/08)

1. Fixed several bugs of the previous release.

2. Revised path-list handling on CygWIN.

3. Added porting to MinGW/MSYS.


MCPP V.2.6 (2006/07)

1. Integrated STANDARD mode and PRE_STANDARD mode into one executable,
    differentiating the modes by the execution time options.

2. Changed --enable-maintainer-mode option of configure to --enable-
    replace-cpp option which generates compiler-specific-build of mcpp.

3. Made compiler-independent-build really independent from any compiler-
    systems.  It no longer requires GCC-specific header files.

4. Removed settings for pre-C90 compiler.
    Removed settings for MS-DOS compiler, DJGPP and Plan9.

5. Added portings to GCC V.4.0, CygWIN 1.5.18, Visual C++ 2005 and LCC-
    Win32 2006-03.
